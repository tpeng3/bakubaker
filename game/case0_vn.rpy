    On a day like any other, we begin our story in the quiet corner of X, a modest and cosy bakery.

    The aroma of baked goods fills the store and the alleys, warming anyone who has the pleasure to stop by.

    Should any sleepy lives follow their nose into the bakery, two busy folks await them with open arms.
