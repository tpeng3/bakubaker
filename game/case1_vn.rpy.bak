    When the curtain of the night lifts, a sleepy town wakes by the gentle glow of morning.

    The townsfolk go about their days, shedding the patchwork quilt of a night's myriad of dreams.

    However... When the townsfolk fall in a deep slumber once more, the visions of night come out to play.

    The fantasies of wondrous reverie entertain those who have nothing to worry about.

    Yet, the troubled fear how their nighttime tales will unfold.

    Luckily, in a quiet corner of the town lies {ii}Café Nemo{/ii}. A cozy café that greets anyone who visits with a warm meal and a warmer atmosphere.

    Their dreamy dishes and a mellow milieu offer a soothing repose from troubled, busy lives.

    Should any uneasy lives trail the starlit streets for the café's incandescent aromas, they'll find two cooks with open arms.
