    When the curtain of the night lifts, a sleepy town is awaken by the gentle glow of morning.

    The patchwork quilt of the prior night's myriad dreams is kicked off, and the townsfolk go about their day.

    But, alas... Once night falls again and the townsfolk begin dreaming, their struggles are laid bare once more.

    Luckily, in a quiet corner of the town lies {ii}cafe name{/ii}, a cozy café that greets anyone who visits with warm meals and a warmer atmosphere.

    Should any sleepy lives follow the café's sweet and savory aroma down the starlight-dusted streets, they'll find two busy cooks awaiting with open arms.

    Beyond the café's inconspicious backdoor and past the checkered tiles of the kitchen was a curious room, simultaneously deep and light, unfamiliar yet intimate.

    It was an office of sorts. Dimly lit, it housed a bed as its centerpiece, a decorative mirror to taste, and a long olden cabinet.

    The two cooks shut the door after their client, and the three of them became enveloped in the velvety deep.

    The insomniac was skeptical to believe incense would work this time, but with nothing left to lose, they closed their eyes nonetheless.

    The aromatic wisps that rolled out shimmered lazily against the glint of the office's few lamps, and seemed to be made of a dream itself.

	As the smoke swirled up lazily into the air, the two, cooks just a moment ago, now began their work as dream eaters.
